Hello Watcher :)

I had the idea to Make a Database with all "knowed" leaks and databreaches i can found free in the internet. 
I put everyone i catch on this list and with the checker tool, you can watch every content from the Database + can check
if one of your accounts got leaked/registerd on the Database. This tool and everything else is still in progress so
i am happy with any type of feedback :)

How to Install:
You Need Python!!
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py

Have fun and Stay tuned

Remember: This is for Education and cybersecurty Only :) i dont support any Illegal Stuff :) i only want to make the internet, to a got Place :)
